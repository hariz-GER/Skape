                        <h2>The Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a creator driven by the belief that every structure tells a story. With a career
                            spanning over 30 years in the construction industry, I have dedicated my life to mastering
                            the technical complexities of the built environment. My journey began with a focus on the
                            structural integrity and skeletal precision of buildings, the "bones" that allow a space to
                            exist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, my vision evolved. For the past four years, I have expanded my practice into
                            interior design to bridge the gap between architectural strength and aesthetic soul. As the
                            founder of Shape of Design, I view myself as an architect of form and function. I do not
                            just build walls; I curate the experiences that happen within them. By combining three
                            decades of engineering logic with a fresh, modern approach to interiors, I provide a
                            holistic perspective that ensures every project is as enduring as it is beautiful.

                        <h3>Interior Design Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>
                            At Shape of Design, our philosophy is rooted in the Science of Space. We believe that
                            interior design is not merely an aesthetic layer applied to a room; it is the final, most
                            intimate stage of architecture. Our approach is defined by the seamless integration of
                            structural history and modern living. We believe that a space must perform before it can
                            please.

                            Because of our 30-year foundation in construction, our design process is uniquely informed
                            by what is possible, not just what is fashionable. We prioritize honest materials,
                            intentional light, and ergonomic flow. We strip away the unnecessary to reveal the inherent
                            shape of a design. To us, luxury is found in the perfect alignment of a client&apos;s
                            lifestyle with the physical environment. We do not follow trends; we create environments
                            that feel inevitable, timeless, and deeply personal.
